# hashutils [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hgruniaux/hashutils.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hgruniaux/hashutils)

`hashutils` provides many command-line programs, multi-platform (Windows, 
MacOS, Linux, etc.), to checksum or hash files based on the C++ library 
[Crypto++](https://cryptopp.com/).

The implemented interface is similar to the utilities programs `sha1sum`,
or `md5sum` found on some POSIX systems. See the files in `src/`, to know
what program, and what hash algorithm is available.
